2. What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities.

Answer:

HTML Entities are special codes used in HTML to represent characters that either have a reserved meaning in HTML (like < or >) or cannot be typed directly on a keyboard. They begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

These entities are important for displaying symbols correctly in a web page without confusing the HTML parser.

Five commonly used HTML entities:

1. &lt;    - Less than symbol (<)
2. &gt;    - Greater than symbol (>)
3. &amp;   - Ampersand (&)
4. &quot;  - Double quotation mark (")
5. &apos;  - Single quotation mark (')
