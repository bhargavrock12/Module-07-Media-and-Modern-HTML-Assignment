6. List any 5 semantic tags in HTML along with their descriptions.

Answer:

Semantic HTML tags clearly describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain. These tags help developers, browsers, and assistive technologies interpret the structure of a webpage more effectively.

Here are five semantic tags and their descriptions:

1. <section>  
   Defines a distinct section of content within a page. It is often used to group related content, such as a group of articles or a chapter in a document.

2. <aside>  
   Represents content that is indirectly related to the main content. Itâ€™s commonly used for sidebars, tips, advertisements, or links that complement the main article.

3. <figure>  
   Used to enclose media elements like images, diagrams, or charts. It often works with the <figcaption> tag to provide a caption or explanation.

4. <mark>  
   Highlights or marks specific text that is important or relevant, such as search terms in a search result.

5. <time>  
   Indicates a specific time or date, allowing browsers or search engines to interpret time-related information in a standardized format.
