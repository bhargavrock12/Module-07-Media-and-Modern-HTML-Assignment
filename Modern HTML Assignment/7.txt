Answer:

Using semantic tags in HTML offers several advantages that improve both the functionality and accessibility of web pages. Below are some key benefits:

   Search engines use the meaning provided by semantic tags to better understand and index the content. This can result in improved search rankings and visibility for the webpage.

4. Consistent Structure  
   Semantic HTML encourages a more organized and consistent page layout, which leads to better user navigation and experience across different devices.

5. Future-Proof Code
