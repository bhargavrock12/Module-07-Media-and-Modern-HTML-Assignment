Answer: 

Key Features of HTML5

1. Enhanced Media Capabilities
   HTML5 allows developers to add audio and video files directly to webpages using the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags—eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.

2. Canvas for Graphics
   The `<canvas>` element in HTML5 makes it possible to draw and render 2D shapes, animations, and graphics on the fly, often used for games and interactive data visualizations.

3. Location-Based Features
   The Geolocation API included in HTML5 lets web applications detect a user's physical location (with permission), which is useful for mapping services, weather updates, and local recommendations.

4. Client-Side Storage
   HTML5 supports local storage through `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, enabling web apps to save data on the user’s browser. This makes applications faster and more reliable, even with limited internet connectivity.

5. New Semantic Elements
   HTML5 introduces meaningful structural tags like `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<nav>`, which improve code readability and help search engines and assistive technologies better understand the content.

6. Smarter Form Controls
   Form handling has been improved with new input types such as `email`, `date`, `range`, and `color`, as well as useful attributes like `required`, `autofocus`, and `placeholder`, making forms more user-friendly and easier to validate.

7. Improved Accessibility Support
   HTML5 enhances accessibility by providing better semantics and native support for alternative text and labeling, helping screen readers and assistive tools interpret page content more effectively.
